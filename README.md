This project implements the game of Breakout.

Name: Cady Zhou

### Timeline

Start Date: 1/11/2020

Finish Date: 1/20/2020

Hours Spent: 20h

### Resources Used
- JavaFX Orcale JavaDoc
- lab_bounce <https://coursework.cs.duke.edu/compsci308_2020spring/lab_bounce>
- Some Stack Overflow pages, but used modified codes
- File Input: <https://curbsidebanter.wordpress.com/2016/05/11/file-inputoutput/>

### Running the Program

- Main class: Main.java

- Data files needed: map_level_('$LEVEL').txt under resources folder   

- Key/Mouse inputs: LEFT/RIGHT to move the paddle, A/D to rotate the paddle, SPACE to release the ball

Cheat keys: NUMBER 1-5 to choose level, R to restart this level, M to have 99 lives

Known Bugs: N/A (Can potentially lower the difficulty of levels, as some of them are too hard for human beings to pass)

Extra credit: The player can rotate the paddle to create move dramatic bounces


### Notes/Assumptions
All functions have been tested to ensure that it works properly.   
Assumptions: 
- A level will not start until the player shoot the ball
- The player needs to re-run the game once lost without using the cheat key R. 
### Impressions
Though finished on time, I still underestimated the hours needed for this project. The implementation itself is not too hard, yet many details need to be considered. I also refactored the project multiple times, and broke many large classes into smaller classes during the process. These time can be saved with a better designing before starting to code next time.
